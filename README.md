# What I learned

- define second order differential equation using symbols mass, gravity, and stretch coefficient

- make animation with 20 frames with pendulum depending on thickness of rubeer band hanging on 200 grams mass

- use frames of the animation to use interact feature

- model a car suspension mechanism when hit a pothole or bump in the road

1. Stretching Rubber
Consider a rubber band suspended from the ceiling with a mass attached to it. The independent variable is time t and we want to model the height of the mass by y(t). The problem has three parameters:
  1. the mass m,
  2. the gravitational constant g, and 
  3. 3. the stretch coefficient s.

All three parameters are positive numbers.
The second order differential equation which governs the height of the mass is
